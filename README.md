# Personal HTML, CSS and JavaScript portfolio 

## Description 

My motivation for this project was to create my first HTML, CSS + JS personal web portfolio. I created the portfolio to showcase the projects I have build and also have a space to which future employers can easily have access and view my projects. In creating the portfolio I wanted it to show my own creative flare and individual approach I take when coding and designing, I hope these are highlighted in the projects being showcased. While making the portfolio I learned many skills, some which stood out were: How to position elements and classes in logical order in HTML and CCS, understanding how margin/padding can effect layouts and the importance of doing a wireframe concept before starting to code.
